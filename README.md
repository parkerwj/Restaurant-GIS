# Overview

As a software engineer eager to advance my learning, I developed a map software to explore the integration of the ArcGIS API and enhance my skills in web development.

The map software allows users to find nearby restaurants with dynamic markers indicating their ratings. Users can filter restaurants based on their ratings using a slider. The data for the restaurants is hardcoded in the script, providing a sample dataset for demonstration.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my abilities in working with mapping APIs and creating interactive web applications.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools and technologies:

- [ArcGIS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Useful Websites

- [ArcGIS API Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and future development:

- Refine the user interface for a more polished look.
- Implement a backend to fetch real-time restaurant data from an external source.
- Create filtering mechanism for more user-friendly interaction.
